## Greedy Algorithms

# Overview
- This repository contains implementations and explanations of various greedy algorithms. Greedy algorithms are a class of algorithms that make the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. They are used in optimization problems and are known for their simplicity and efficiency.

# Introduction
- Greedy algorithms are iterative methods that build up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit. They are useful for a variety of problems, including but not limited to:

* Activity Selection: Selecting the maximum number of activities that don't overlap.
* Fractional Knapsack Problem: Maximizing the total value of items placed in a knapsack of fixed capacity.
* Huffman Coding: Compressing data by assigning variable-length codes to characters.
* Prim's and Kruskal's Algorithms: Finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph.
